# AMandEnergy
Repo for data analysis of annular modes (BAM and SAM) and connection to the energy cycle â€” particularly would like to see if there is any changes in the 40 years of ERA5 data. Uses ERA5 and UCAR JupyterHub for computing, a project for OP's atmospheric dynamics class in CAOS/Courant.
